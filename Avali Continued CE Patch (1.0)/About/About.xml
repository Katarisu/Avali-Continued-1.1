	<description>Makes Eriss's and my Avali mod compatable with Combat Extended.\nCE doesn't work with the Hacking mechanic, so it is turned off in this patch.\nLoad after the Avali mod (and after the Avali tweak mod if you have it). \nWhile it theoretically works with old saves, your weapons will not have ammunition and I reccomend to start a new save just in case anyway.</description>
